### Game Summary
With the high demand of Laksa in the modern world, people are all craving to have their hunger sated, some with different needs
 and hangry tolerance. With enemies coming in all shapes and sizes, eg Sumos, Food Critiques, 'That' Korean MukBang Influencer, or the
 average Joe. Tower defense but with the emergence of gacha, you must wish for your chefs, will you risk it all in the premium gacha or the
 standard gacha to summon your chefs on the field. Upon Choosing a map, you will have a choice to spend your starting coins on 4 standard pulls,
 or 1 premium and 1 standard to protect your kitchen from the waves of hungry citizens. You can place your chefs on the map and upgrade them to
 take them closer to their potentials. Save the kitchen for as long as you can as the waves won't stop until they are sated! Be careful for the
 Rich tourists, or even the rush hour... See you in the laksa kitchen!

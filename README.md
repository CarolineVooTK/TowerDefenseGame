### Game Summary

With the high demand of Laksa in the modern world, people are all craving to have their hunger sated, some with different needs and hangry tolerance. With enemies coming in all shapes and sizes, eg Sumos, Food Critiques, 'That' Korean MukBang Influencer, or the average Joe. Tower defense but with the emergence of gacha, you must wish for your chefs, will you risk it all in the premium gacha or the standard gacha to summon your chefs on the field. Upon Choosing a map, you will have a choice to spend your starting coins on 2 standard pulls, or 1 premium to protect your kitchen from the waves of hungry citizens. You can place your chefs on the map and upgrade them to take them closer to their potentials. Save the kitchen for as long as you can as the waves won't stop until they are sated! Be careful for the Rich tourists, or even the rush hour... See you in the laksa kitchen!

### Technologies

Project is created with:

* Unity 2022.1.9f1
* Blender version 3.3.0
* Canva

### How To Play The Game

#### 1. Select map

Theres a selection between 3 different themed maps that you could pick from; Castle, Desert, and Shore.

</p>

#### 2. Start the game and select a scroll (Standard Scroll or Premium Scroll)

<p align="center">
    <img src="Gifs/select_scroll.gif" width="500">
</p>
    At the start of the game you are given 500 Laksa Coins which could be used to purchase either 2 Standard Scroll or 1 Premium Scroll; a Standard Scroll costs 200 Laksa Coins and a Premium Scroll costs for 400 Laksa Coins. With a higher price, Premium Scroll would have higher odds on recruiting a more professional chef. Each chef is unique as they would feed citizens their speciality cuisine.

Here are the gacha chances you would be faced when purchasing a scroll:

</p>

#### 3. Purchase scroll

Place the scroll beside the path that has different color than the base map. Usually 1 tile beside the paths of the citizen. See what chef you have recruited!

#### 4. Enjoy the chefs feeding the citizens

Let the chef feed the citizens their specialised foods. Once the citizens are full, they would exlode and give us coins.

#### 5. Defend Kitchen

Use coins to purchase more scroll and test your luck to defend the kitchen!

\* Protip: If you place the scroll on the correct tile and have enough money, you can spam and purchase multiple scrolls!

### Gameplay Related Design

#### Maps

#### Citizen, Chef, Food

The citizens, chefs, and foods are customly modeled and rendered through Blender version 3.3.0. Initially we wanted to create a 3D cartoon game which has an overhead camera. Therefore, we took heavy inspiration on the models based on the game Overcooked 2. It has the foods, people, and chefs that is very similar to our concept. Additionally, it has a overhead camera point of view so when designing we knew already  roughly how our model would look in Unity. The baseframe of the people are similar to Overcooked 2, round head and a cone with half sphere as a base body. These models only have solid colors without any texture. We wanted to keep it clean and simple.

Design  Inspirations:
* Citizen
    * Average Joe: Overcooked 2 chefs without chef attributes
    * Marathon Cindy: Sinead Diver, an Australian long distance runner
    * Sumo Miyama: Wakatakakage Atsushi, a Japanese professional sumo wrestler
    * Mukbanger Kim Jong Duos: Teenagers with baseball hat
    * Food Critic Anton Ego: Anton Ego from movie Ratatouille
    * Rich Man Bill Fences: Aristocrat with a top hat
* Chef
    * Sushiherro Yuji: Sushi chefs with traditional headband
    * Laksa Mania Caroline: Normal chef from Overcooked 2
    * Indomie Ivy: Indonesian with traditional ricefield hat
    * Coco's Rosie: Basic person
    * Pizza Izza: Normal chef from Overcooked 2
    * Kami's Chungen: Sushi chefs with traditional headband
    * Dunkin Dougie: Dunkin Doughnut staff
    * Sunbucks Bucky: Starbucks staff
    * Trainway Bucky: Subway staff
    * Farmer Dan: American farmer
* Food
    * Sushi: 6 set of sushi with salmon, cucumber, and carrot
    * Laksa: Stir-fried pork food in Overcooked 2 as the soup and a simple bowl
    * Indomie: A pack  of indomie
    * Boba: Gongcha's boba drink
    * Pizza: Pepperoni pizza
    * Korean Chicken: 2 drumstick fried chicken
    * Doughnut: Doughnut with pink icing
    * Coffee: Starbucks coffee drink with sleve
    * Sandwich: Grilled cheese sandwhich
    * Egg: An egg
    * Meat: Raw porterhouse meat
    * Carrot: A carrot

### Particle System

We have implemented 2 particle system in Laksa Mania. Both particle system are implemented when the chefs throws food on the citizens. One is a tiny effect of crumbs falling off when the citizen consumes the food (when food collides with citizens). The other one which we would love to highlight is when the  citizen is full, it will explode into coin particles.These coin particles would represent that when citizens are full, player would gain coins from them.

The implementation file can be located in <https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-laksa-novona/blob/main/Assets/Prefabs/Particle%20System/particle_system_enemy.prefab>.

Below are the particle systems that we varied:

| Name            | Option          | Values                |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |
| Particle System | Duration        | 1                     |
|                 | Start Lifetime  | 4                     |
|                 | Start Speed     | [0,5]                 |
|                 | Start Size      | [0.5,1.5]             |
| Emission        | Burst           | 2 Count in 5 Cycles, 0.01 Interval   |
| Shape           | Shape           | Sphere                |
|                 | Radius          | 0.08                  |
| Renderer        | Render Mode     | Mesh                  |
|                 | Meshes          | Coin Mesh             |
|                 | Material        | Gold with Toon Shader |

We utilized randomisation using the feature "Random Between Two Constants" on the start speed and most importantly the start size. The start size is decided in ratio with the citizens so it won't be too big covering other actions but not too small making it unseen. Aside from that we also used burst emissions so theres more randomization by implementing 5 cycles with 0.01 interval and 2 particle each.
